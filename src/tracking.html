            <h4>Online Tracking</h4>
            <p>Published by: Johnny Pillacela</p>

            <p> “The most common tools to collect information about us are so called cookies.”
                They are tiny files placed on your computer by your browser when you visit websites
                There are two types of Cookies:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Session cookies
                </li>
                <li>
                    Persistent cookies
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Session Cookies are your friend. They keep you logged into your account when you move from one page to
                another. Say you are on Amazon.com trying to buy a camera. If you add the camera to your cart then go to
                the
                checkout page, you would have been logged out as soon as you leave the page you were on. Due to session
                cookies, when you go to another page you aren’t logged out which is a good thing because no one wants to
                log
                in again every single time they go onto another page. “Session cookies are stored only as long as your
                current session and should be deleted as soon as you log off a website.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, “persistent cookies can be good or bad depending on how you look at it.’ They are
                placed
                in your computer as a file and stay in your computer as a file put there by your browser. “They are used
                mainly by marketing firms to track your browsing history.” For example, if you are once again trying to
                buy
                a camera and have been searching for them on a lot of websites, then you probably have a cookie of your
                recent search history saved on your computer. Websites or marketing firms can then use your cookies to
                promote other cameras on other websites. If you are on the official Canon website you might see an ad
                for a
                camera from Sony and vice versa if you were already on the official Sony website looking for a camera
                there.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, what if you already bought a camera or aren’t interested in buying a camera anymore? Seeing
                camera
                ads everywhere can quickly become annoying and intrusive. Therefore, these persistent cookie may be good
                or
                bad depending on the situation that you may be in.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also be tracked by something called, Browser Fingerprinting. “When you visit a website, the
                site’s
                web server has the ability to transfer a snippet of Javascript code to the browser. Your browser then
                executes that script on your device. The code can then collect information about,
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Installed Extensions</li>
                <li>Browser types and names</li>
                <li>Time Zones</li>
                <li>Screen Resolution</li>
                <li>Adblock presence</li>
                <li>List of available fonts</li>
                <li>Computer hardware</li>
                <li>And much more information that you don’t know that can be collected”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                After the JavaScript code collects some or all the information it required, it gets saved as you
                fingerprint. You fingerprint then gets sent back to the sites servers to most likely be saved in their
                database.
                So whenever you visit that same site again, that site can identify you by your fingerprint. If multiple
                sites share your fingerprint they can also identify you.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, what type of information is being collected from us, the user? Well you will be surprised.
                Information
                they collect can include your
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Age</li>
                <li>Gender</li>
                <li>Marital status</li>
                <li>Address and location</li>
                <li>Our favorite TV show or Movie</li>
                <li>What we like</li>
                <li>And much more that we don’t know.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                From the sites that you visit, the information that they may collect my be used to create individual
                profiles for each of their users. They use these profiles to then determine what you like or don’t like
                and
                promote relevant ads or products to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just from the fact that these sites can collect very personal information about us sounds scary. But,
                there
                isn’t much we can do. To begin with, we can stop using free services such as Instagram, Google products,
                or
                free games, as these companies mainly try to profile you as best as possible to deliver relevant ads.
                Most
                of us can’t live without Instagram so there goes our online privacy, right?
            </p>
            <p>
                Well not really. What we can do is minimize how much of our personal information gets collected and
                tracked.
                We can do this by
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Deleting our internet browsing history and deleting cookies after every use
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using privacy browsers such as Duck Duck Go and firefox which delete cookies after every use
                    automatically in their settings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Checking what permissions you have allowed on certain apps
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ask yourself the trade off. Is my privacy worth their service.
                </li>
            </ul>
