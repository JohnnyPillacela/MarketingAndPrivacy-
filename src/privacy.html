            <h4>Privacy Laws</h4>
            <p>Published by: Johnny Pillacela</p>
            <img class="titleImage" src="../image/judge.jpg">
            <p> When we sing up for an account on a new social media site. What type of information are we allowing them
                to access from us? What are we allowing them to do with our information? If we all took the time to read
                the terms of service before clicking on the “create new account” button, we might know.
                But let’s be honest, no one reads the terms of service. Thankfully, there are internet privacy laws
                collectively that protect our personal information online.
                According to Reuter, some of these laws include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <Strong>The Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC)[1914] – </strong> unfair or deceptive commercial
                    practices.
                    The FTC is the primary federal regulator in the privacy area and brings enforcement actions
                    against
                    companies. This includes failing to comply with posted privacy policies and failing to
                    adequately
                    protect personal information.

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) [1986] - </strong>protects certain wire, oral, and
                    electronic
                    communications from unauthorized interception, access, use, and disclosure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fraud & Abuse Act (CFAA) [1986] –</strong> makes unlawful certain computer-related
                    activities
                    involving the unauthorized access of a computer to obtain certain information, defraud or obtain
                    anything of value, transmit harmful items, or traffic in computer passwords. The law has been in
                    amended
                    six times.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) [1998] – </strong>requires certain website
                    and online
                    service
                    providers to obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting, using, or disclosing personal
                    information from minors under the age of 13. It also requires websites to post an online privacy
                    policy,
                    collect only the personal information necessary, and create and maintain reasonable security
                    measures.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM Act) [2003]
                        –</strong>
                    governs
                    sending unsolicited commercial email and prohibits misleading header information and deceptive
                    subject
                    lines. It also requires senders to disclose certain information, include a valid opt-out mechanism,
                    and
                    it creates civil and criminal penalties for violations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Financial Services Modernization Act (GLBA) [1999] – </strong>regulates the collection, use,
                    and disclosure
                    of
                    personal information collected or held by financial institutions and requires customer notices and a
                    written information security program.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA) [2003] – </strong>requires financial
                    institutions and
                    creditors to maintain written identity theft prevention programs.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Another important thing to note is that just because there are laws protecting our personal information,
                there are people who break laws and purposefully try to steal our personal information for their own
                benefit, whatever that may be. This is why it is important to know how to use the Internet and learn it
                at a young age like yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, what can we do to protect ourselves from internet law breakers?
                Well, there are a couple of things you can do. These include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Paying attention to the website url you are currently visiting. </strong>If you want to go
                    on Facebook make
                    sure the website address is www.Facebook.com instead of www.Facebok.com Did you catch that? There
                    are
                    two o’s in the official Facebook website. The other site may take you to a Facebook clone and
                    possibly
                    steal your information if you provide it with.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Buy an anti-virus program </strong>and use trusted internet browsers such as Google Chrome,
                    Firefox, or
                    Microsoft Edge.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Delete cookies </strong>after you finish browsing the internet. For more information on
                    cookies view the “How
                    you are being tracked in the web” tab. The reason you want to delete your cookies is because a
                    website
                    that you may have visited will sell your information to third parties, profiting off of you. Plus,
                    some
                    unknown company now has your personal information. That’s creepy!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Buy a virtual private network,</strong> also known as a VPN. A VPN can literally make you
                    invisible when you
                    browse the internet online. It can even make you be in different places of the world. For example,
                    if
                    you are currently visiting South Africa but want to watch a British TV show, you can do so with a
                    VPN.
                    Not only that, but while connected to the VPN, websites that you visit will also think that you are
                    in
                    Britain, even though you are in South Africa. Amazing!
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                While you are still young don’t be afraid to explore the internet. DO be careful though. Anything can
                happen online.
